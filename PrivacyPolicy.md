Privacy Policy for Yern

Last updated: 27/12/2025

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Yern (“the App”) handles user data.

Publisher: Kristián Nemček
App name: Yern

Yern is a local time-tracking application for Windows that helps users understand how much time they spend using different applications. Protecting your privacy is a core principle of the app’s design.

2. Data We Collect

Yern collects only the minimum data necessary to provide its core functionality.

The App collects the following information locally on your device:

Names of applications you use

Duration of time each application is used

The App does not collect:

Keystrokes or keyboard input

Screenshots or screen recordings

Window titles

URLs or browser activity

File contents

Personal communications

Audio or video

Location data

3. How Data Is Collected

Yern runs a background process on your device to monitor which applications are active and for how long. This monitoring occurs only on your local device and is required for the App’s time-tracking functionality.

No monitoring extends beyond application names and usage duration.

4. How We Use the Data

The collected data is used only to:

Display time-tracking statistics to you

Provide summaries of application usage within the App

The data is not used for:

Advertising

Analytics

Profiling

Automated decision-making

Any purpose unrelated to the App’s core functionality

5. Data Storage and Security

All data collected by Yern is:

Stored locally on your device

Never transmitted to external servers

Never uploaded to the cloud

Never shared with the publisher or any third party

The App does not use cloud services, remote databases, or online storage of any kind.

6. Data Sharing

Yern does not share data with any third parties.

Because all data remains on your device, no data is sold, transferred, or disclosed to external entities.

7. User Control and Data Deletion

You are always in full control of your data.

You can delete your data by:

Uninstalling the App (this removes all locally stored data), or

Manually deleting the local database files stored on your device

The App does not retain any copies of your data after deletion.

8. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Yern processes data based on:

User consent, by choosing to install and use the App

Legitimate interest, as the data processing is strictly necessary to provide the App’s functionality

Because data never leaves your device, no international data transfers occur.

9. Children’s Privacy

Yern is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or under 16 in the European Union).

The App does not knowingly collect personal data from children.

10. Future Features

Future versions of Yern may introduce optional features such as cloud synchronization.
If such features are added, this Privacy Policy will be updated before those features are enabled.

Users will always be informed of material changes to data handling practices.

11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.

Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date at the top of this document.
